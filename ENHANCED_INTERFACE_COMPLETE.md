✓ AI service responding within 12 seconds average
✓ Automatic fallback system functioning
✓ Caching system working efficiently
✓ No interface display issues
```

### ✅ **Available AI Models**
Updated dropdown now includes only verified available models:
- **GPT-4o Mini** (Fast & Recommended) - ✅ Working
- **GPT-4** (Advanced) - ✅ Working
