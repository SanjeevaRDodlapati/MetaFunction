class BudgetPredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            'time_series': ARIMAModel(),
            'ml_ensemble': RandomForestRegressor(),
            'linear_trend': LinearRegression()
        }
    
    def predict_monthly_costs(self, historical_data, growth_rate=0.1):
        # Combine multiple prediction models
        predictions = {}
        for name, model in self.models.items():
            predictions[name] = model.forecast(historical_data)
        
        # Weighted ensemble prediction
        final_prediction = self._ensemble_predict(predictions)
        
        # Apply growth adjustments
        return self._apply_growth_factors(final_prediction, growth_rate)
```

### 3. Automated Cost Governance

**Policy Engine:**

**Governance Rules:**
```yaml
# Cost Governance Policies
cost_governance:
  approval_workflows:
    - threshold: $1000
      approvers: ["team_lead"]
      auto_approve_if: "environment == 'dev'"
    
    - threshold: $5000
      approvers: ["engineering_manager", "finance"]
      require_justification: true
  
  automated_actions:
    - condition: "environment == 'dev' AND time > '18:00'"
      action: "scale_to_zero"
      exceptions: ["ci-cd", "monitoring"]
    
    - condition: "unused_resources > 72h"
